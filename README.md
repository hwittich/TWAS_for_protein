# Testing predicted expression levels for association with protein abundance

Recent studies of the heritability of complex traits describe an omnigenic model, where a small proportion of trait inheritance is controlled by a few core genes with strong effects and the majority of trait inheritance is controlled by many small, distal (_trans_-acting) genetic effects. Often, _trans_-eQTL act through _cis_-mediators like nearby transcription factor genes, thus many _trans_-eQTL are also _cis_-eQTL. In this study, we performed a TWAS, testing the _cis_-genetically regulated component of gene expression for association with the measured abundance of proteins, to discover regulatory relationships between genes that are driven by _cis_-mediation. While traditional eQTL mapping studies are limited in their ability to detect _trans_-acting genetic variants due to the high multiple testing burden and the low effect sizes of _trans_-eQTL, our SNP prioritization method improved detection of _trans_-eQTL by reducing the multiple testing burden.
